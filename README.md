- Hi, I'm Ioseb (Soso) Gvritishvili a Front-end engineer, born in the marketing and creative industry, with professional coding experience since 2016. 
Skilled in
```
JS, TS, Vue â…”., Nuxt, React Native, HTML, CSS(SCSS, BEM, Tailwind), REST Api, Unit and E2E tests. 
```
Prefer working on Front-end technologies, also I have experience working with PHP world: laravel and wordpres.
Focused on clean and clear code. Iâ€™m a pedant and perfectionist in coding and doing my job perfectly.
I'm not sitting in one pose, trying to always be in touch with modern technologies and learn new things every day to write a better, faster, and easier to understand program code.
Mostly I am working with Vue, but i also have experience with react native, maybe someday I will back to developing mobile apps, but for now, because of my current job, this is not my agenda.
